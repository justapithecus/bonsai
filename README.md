# Bonsai

**Cultivating software in proportion**

Bonsai is a read-only practice for observing and stewarding software portfolios over long periods of time.

Rather than optimizing for activity, output, or popularity, Bonsai helps developers understand their projects in terms of intent, structure, change, and fit. It exists to support pruning, preservation, deliberate inaction, and long-horizon care.

Bonsai treats software projects as living systems. Growth is not assumed to be good. Activity is not assumed to be progress.

## What Bonsai Is

- A portfolio-level lens for understanding code over time
- A way to notice drift, excess, stagnation, and quiet completion
- An alternative to social trust signals like stars or hype
- A tool for deciding what to leave alone

---

## What Bonsai Is Not

- A productivity tool
- A task, issue, or project manager
- A replacement for GitHub, GitLab, or git itself
- A scoring, ranking, or gamification system
- A system that demands attention or action

Bonsai is observational, not corrective.

## The Model

Bonsai evaluates projects through a simple, fixed lens:

**Intent → Shape → Motion → Fit → Action (or Inaction)**

- **Intent** — what the project claims to be
- **Shape** — what the code looks like
- **Motion** — how it changes over time
- **Fit** — alignment between intent, shape, and motion
- **Action** — prune, preserve, freeze, split, archive… or do nothing

Inaction is a valid and often correct outcome.

## Core Assumptions

- Growth is not inherently good
- Stability is not neglect
- Popularity is not health
- Maintenance is a form of care
- Restraint is a design choice

---

## Status

This project is in **Phase 0**.

No UI.  
No automation.  
No recommendations.

The current focus is defining the model, language, and constraints before any implementation.
