# Grove

A stewardship engine for long-running software ecosystems.

Grove helps you observe the structural integrity of your projects over time. It is complementary to GitHub, not competitive with it. It is focused on proportion, alignment, and care — not activity, velocity, or output.

## Core Principles

- **Declared horizons.** Projects state their intended lifespan and scope.
- **Explicit stewardship.** Someone is named responsible. Responsibility is visible.
- **Rest and consolidation.** Periods of inactivity are features, not bugs.
- **No gamification.** No streaks, badges, leaderboards, or achievement systems.
- **No ranking.** Projects are not ordered by desirability.
- **No scoring.** Observations are not collapsed into single values.

## Modes

### Ecology Mode (default)

Structural observation. Grove reads declared intent and observed structure, then surfaces tension, drift, and disproportion. It does not prescribe action.

### Cosmology Mode (future)

Long-horizon projection derived from ecology primitives. Optional. Not yet implemented.

---

## Status

Grove is in early experimental development.

The current focus is establishing doctrine, contracts, and the first observation primitives before building UI or automation.

## Philosophy

See [`docs/philosophy.md`](docs/philosophy.md) for the long-horizon stewardship framing that motivates Grove.
