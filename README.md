# Grove

A stewardship engine for long-running software ecosystems.

Software exists in seasons. Projects expand, consolidate, are pruned, and rest. All systems — natural or synthetic — obey constraints. Grove observes these conditions; it does not direct them.

Modern tools measure activity. Grove observes rhythm.

## What Grove Observes

Declared intent and whether structure aligns with it.
Named stewardship — who is responsible, and whether that is visible.
Structural integrity over time.
Consolidation cadence — rhythm, not deadlines.
Dependency gravity across a portfolio.
Seasonal atmosphere derived from declared phase.
Ecological balance — proportion and distribution of attention.

---

## What Grove Does Not Do

No velocity measurement. No sprint tracking.
No ranking of repositories or people.
No scoring — observations are not collapsed into single values.
No gamification. No streaks. No badges.
No alerts. No urgency. No notifications that demand attention.
No intent inference. Intent is declared by humans.

Inaction is a first-class outcome.

## Relationship to GitHub

Grove is complementary to GitHub, not competitive with it. GitHub shows what happened — commits, pull requests, activity. Grove shows what it means to the people who care for the code over time.

Where GitHub shows activity, Grove shows seasons.

## Status

Grove is in Phase 1 — building the first observation engine and read-only interface. Phase 0 doctrine and contracts are substantially complete.
