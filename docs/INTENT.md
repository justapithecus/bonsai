# INTENT.md

## Canonical Intent

Grove exists to support the **stewardship of software portfolios over time**.

It is concerned with proportion, alignment, and care — not activity maximization, production, or growth.

Grove treats software projects as living systems whose condition cannot be inferred from activity, popularity, or momentum alone.

---

## What Grove Centers

Grove centers:

- **Legibility over cleverness**
- **Alignment over acceleration**
- **Proportion over growth**
- **Observation over intervention**
- **Long-horizon thinking over short-term metrics**

Grove assumes that:
- growth is not inherently beneficial
- stability is not neglect
- inactivity may be intentional
- restraint is a form of care

---

## What Grove Refuses to Center

Grove explicitly does not center:

- activity maximization
- speed
- volume
- utilization
- popularity or social proof
- engagement or retention
- automation of decision-making

Any capability that meaningfully centers these is out of scope.

## The Role of Grove

Grove is **read-only and observational**.

It may surface:
- tension
- drift
- disproportion
- stagnation
- quiet completion

It may not:
- prescribe action
- create urgency
- rank projects or people
- declare outcomes as favorable or unfavorable

Grove’s role ends at **making conditions visible**.

Action — including inaction — remains a human responsibility.

---

## Intent Is Declared, Not Inferred

Grove requires that project intent be **explicitly declared by humans**.

Intent includes, but is not limited to:
- purpose
- audience
- expected lifespan
- acceptable complexity
- expected rate of change

Grove will never infer intent from:
- code structure
- activity patterns
- dependency graphs
- popularity
- historical behavior

When intent changes, it must change explicitly.

---

## Scope of Application

Grove is designed to be useful for:

- individuals managing multiple projects
- long-lived personal codebases
- open-source portfolios
- exploratory or cyclical work
- software that is allowed to rest

Grove does not assume:
- teams
- deadlines
- roadmaps
- commercial incentives

These may exist, but are not required.

---

## On Slowness

Grove is intentionally slow.

It must remain useful even if:
- opened infrequently
- updated irregularly
- consulted only a few times per year

Any capability that requires frequent attention in order to be effective violates this intent.

---

## On Measurement

Metrics in Grove are **contextual signals**, not scores.

Measurements exist only to support stewardship questions.

If a measurement:
- cannot be interpreted relative to declared intent
- encourages comparison without context
- collapses nuance into a single value

…it does not belong in Grove.

---

## Failure Modes (Explicitly Guarded Against)

Grove must not become:

- an activity dashboard
- a code quality scorecard
- a CI system
- a project management tool
- a popularity contest
- a prescriptive advisor

If Grove drifts toward any of these, it has moved away from its intent.

---

## North Star Constraint

> Grove must remain valuable even if it never grows, never becomes popular, and never demands attention.

If Grove changes how a developer decides what **not** to work on, it has served its intent.

---

## Intent Stability

This document is expected to change **rarely**.

Any change to this file should be treated as a foundational shift and reviewed with extreme care.
