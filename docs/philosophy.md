# Philosophy

Grove is shaped by a small number of convictions about software stewardship.

These are not rules. They are the reasoning behind the rules.

## Anti-financialized velocity

Software is not a financial instrument. Commits are not transactions. Repositories are not assets under management. The impulse to measure, accelerate, and extract from codebases distorts the relationship between a developer and their work.

Grove refuses to treat code as a production line.

---

## Organic growth

Growth emerges from care and context. It is not imposed by roadmaps, quotas, or external pressure. A project that grows slowly — or not at all — may be doing exactly what it should.

Grove does not assume growth is desirable.

---

## Constraint clarity

Constraints are explicit, not discovered through failure. A project's boundaries — its intended lifespan, acceptable complexity, expected audience — should be declared upfront and revisited deliberately.

Grove surfaces where reality departs from declared constraints. It does not invent constraints on the developer's behalf.

---

## Long-horizon compounding

Value accrues over years, not sprints. The most important qualities of a codebase — legibility, structural integrity, alignment with intent — are slow to build and easy to erode.

Grove is designed for observation cadences measured in months and years.

---

## Rhythm as structure

Cadence is a structural property of stewardship, not a productivity measure. Rituals — structured, reflective, repeating checkpoints — provide temporal shape to the act of caring for software over time.

Rhythm is not about doing things at the right time. It is about having a temporal relationship with a codebase that is deliberate rather than reactive. A steward who reflects on a project quarterly is not more virtuous than one who reflects annually. The rhythm itself is the structure.

Seasonal awareness — noticing that a project feels like it is in consolidation, or dormancy, or pruning — is an act of perception, not measurement. It shapes attention without directing action.

Rhythm resists optimization. The moment a cadence becomes "optimal," it has become a deadline in disguise.

---

## No decision engines

Grove observes. It does not decide. It does not recommend actions or optimize outcomes. It does not prioritize. The moment a system begins prescribing action, it begins encoding values that may not be shared by the person using it.

Grove may invite reflection through structured rituals. A ritual is a checkpoint, not a recommendation. It shapes temporal attention without directing what that attention should produce.

All interpretation beyond surfaced observation is the responsibility of the human steward.

---

## Rest as design

Periods of inactivity are features, not bugs. A project that is resting may be consolidating, waiting for external conditions to change, or simply complete.

Dormancy is not uniform. A project in hibernation rests with the expectation of future re-engagement — it is still-living but intentionally still. A project in survival persists in a minimal state, preserved but not expected to resume. Both are valid. Neither requires intervention.

Grove treats stillness with the same attention it gives to motion.
