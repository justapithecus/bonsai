# ANTI_PATTERNS.md

## Purpose

Describe patterns that indicate drift away from Grove's intent and contracts.

These are signals to pause and reconsider, not instructions to act.

---

## Drift Patterns

1. **Prescriptive Output**  
   Any wording that directs action or implies a required next step.

2. **Urgency Framing**  
   Language that implies immediacy, pressure, or time-sensitive obligation.

3. **Ranking or Scoring**  
   Any single value, grade, score, or ordering of repositories or people.

4. **Intent Inference**  
   Labels or conclusions about intent derived from code, metadata, activity, or popularity.

5. **Actionable Automation**  
   Features that apply changes, open edit paths, or trigger external workflows.

6. **Task System Import**  
   Issue tracking, backlogs, roadmaps, or workflow systems embedded in Grove.

7. **Metric Collapse**  
   Reducing multiple contextual signals into a single value, verdict, or summary judgment.

8. **Context-Free Comparison**  
   Comparing projects without shared or explicitly declared intent.

9. **Interpretation Without Observation**  
   Conclusions that cannot be traced to observed data or explicitly declared intent.

10. **Attention Demand**  
    Mechanisms that require frequent visits, monitoring, or interaction to remain useful.

11. **Popularity Gravity**  
    Emphasis on social proof, stars, forks, adoption, or external attention.

12. **Judgmental Language**  
    Terms that imply merit, blame, success, failure, or outcome judgments.

13. **Over-Observation**  
    Accumulating measurements, probes, or analyses beyond what is necessary to support stewardship questions, increasing anxiety without improving clarity.

14. **False Precision**
    Presenting observations with a level of exactness or confidence that exceeds the reliability or context of the underlying data.

15. **Ritual Gamification**
    Tracking ritual completion, measuring adherence rates, or creating incentives around ritual engagement. Rituals are invitations, not achievements.

16. **Seasonal Urgency**
    Using seasonal transitions or phase durations to create time pressure, deadline-like framing, or calls to action. Seasons describe atmosphere, not schedules.

17. **Climate Enforcement**
    Using the declared climate to prescribe phase changes, prioritize projects, or direct portfolio rebalancing. Climate/season tension is surfaced, not enforced.

18. **Rhythm Optimization**
    Analyzing ritual cadences, seasonal durations, or engagement patterns to suggest "optimal" timing, frequency, or participation. Rhythm resists optimization.

## Usage Notes

The presence of an anti-pattern does not imply failure.

Anti-patterns are indicators of conceptual drift and should prompt:
- review of intent
- review of contracts
- reduction or removal of features

When in doubt, prefer omission.
