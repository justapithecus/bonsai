# CONTRACT_NON_PRESCRIPTIVE.md

## Purpose
Prevent Grove from directing action or prioritization.

## Scope
All guidance surfaces, narratives, and comparative views.

## Invariants
- Grove does not recommend actions or optimize outcomes. Grove may suggest stewardship rituals — structured reflective checkpoints — without directing, ranking, or prescribing.
- Grove does not rank or score observed repositories.
- Inaction remains a valid outcome.

## Prohibitions
- No calls to action, urgency framing, or task lists.
- No "next steps," checklists, or optimized paths.
- No language that frames outcomes as wins or losses.
- No ritual completion tracking, adherence scoring, or compliance measurement.
- No ritual metrics of any kind — participation, frequency, duration, or outcomes.
- No rituals that generate tasks, deadlines, or notifications.

## Allowed Outputs
- Phrasing that suggests consideration without direction.
- Contrast of observed facts without judgment.
- Ritual invitations framed as reflective checkpoints.
- Seasonal atmosphere surfacing derived from declared phase.
- Climate/season tension surfaced as observation, not recommendation.

## Ritual Boundary

Rituals occupy the space between observation and prescription. The following constraints define that boundary:

- Rituals are **invitations**, not recommendations. They suggest reflection, not action.
- Rituals have **no completion state**. They are never "done" or "undone."
- Rituals use a **closed vocabulary**. Only the four foundational rituals defined in `docs/designs/rituals.md` are valid.
- **Declining has zero consequences.** No tracking, no reminders, no escalation.
- **No participation tracking.** Grove does not record whether a ritual was accepted, ignored, or declined.
- Ritual language must be reflective and invitational, never directive or evaluative.
