## Purpose
Observe cognitive legibility without judging quality.

## Scope
Documentation, onboarding flow, and local context signals.

## Invariants

- Signals are described without implied merit or blame.
- Measures are tied to specific moments or artifacts.

## Prohibitions
- No labeling as "clear" or "unclear" without observed evidence.
- No grading, scoring, or ranking of accessibility.
- No prescriptive guidance on how to improve legibility.

## Allowed Outputs
- Descriptions of where context was required and how it was found.
- Lists of missing or ambiguous references encountered.
