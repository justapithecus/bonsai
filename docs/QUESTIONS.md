# QUESTIONS.md

## Purpose

This document enumerates the stewardship questions Grove is allowed to surface.

Questions are observational, not prescriptive.  
They are designed to guide attention, not action.

---

## Usage

- Questions are stable identifiers; numbering is part of the interface.
- Each question maps to one or more model dimensions defined in `MODEL.md`.
- If a question cannot be answered from observed data, it must remain unanswered rather than inferred.

---

## Intent

1. What intent has been explicitly declared for this project, and when was it last updated?
2. Which declared intent fields are missing, ambiguous, or unspecified?

---

## Shape

3. What is the current structural shape of the project (files, languages, dependencies)?
4. How is structural complexity distributed across the project?

---

## Motion

5. How has the project changed over time (cadence, churn, inactivity)?
6. What patterns of change are visible (bursty, steady, irregular)?
7. Where is change concentrated (directories, modules, components)?
8. How concentrated is change across contributors over time?
21. What long periods of inactivity are visible, if any?
22. What parts of the project have remained stable over extended spans?
23. What parts of the project show repeated churn without sustained change in shape?

---

## Accessibility

9. What prerequisites are required to set up or engage with the project?
10. How legible are the setup steps relative to the declared intent and audience?
11. Where does setup require external context not provided in the repository?
12. What errors or blockers are encountered during setup or initial use?

---

## Capability

13. What behaviors can be observed when the project is exercised today?
14. Which documented behaviors do not manifest in observed runs?
15. What environmental assumptions are required for observed behaviors?

---

## Fit

16. How do observed behaviors align with the declared intent?
17. Where do intent and current shape appear in tension?
18. Where do intent and current motion appear in tension?
19. Where do intent and accessibility signals appear in tension?
20. Where do intent and capability observations appear in tension?

---

## Epistemic Boundaries

24. What is explicitly unknown due to missing intent or missing observation data?
